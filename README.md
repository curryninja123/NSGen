Number Sense Generator Program
==============================

This program is made for the Dulles High School UIL Number Sense team. When run, the program generates a test used mainly for practice purposes and should not be mistaken for one that generates a realistic test. The writer does not have any affiliation with the University Interscholastic League.

In order to run it, download the files, open a terminal with Python loaded on it, and move to the project directory. Once you are there, type <code>python NumberSenseGenerator.py</code> and a file called "test.tex" would have been generated. Copy the file data and paste it into a LaTeX compiler to create a pdf of the Number Sense Test.
